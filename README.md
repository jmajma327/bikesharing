2.As we began exploring more of the data in the challenge the second visualization created was the trip duration. This chart indicated that most riders use the bikes for 4-6 hours.


3.The third visualization that was created was an extension to the second visualization as where we look at trip duration based on gender. We looked at usage based on gender male, female, and unknown.


4.The fourth visualization and data results shows the trips taken by weekday per hour. This is a heatmap shows that during the week the bike usage is much higher in hours where people are not working, and on the weekend more evenly spread out. This result is probably because people have more free time on the weekend than during the work week.

5.The fifth visualization shows trips taken by weekday per hour by gender. This data shows that the men and women use the bikes in the same way but that men have more usage on the bikes.

6.The last visualization was a filtered heatmap that shows types by gender by weekday. This also indicated that the male users still had the highest usage than female during the weekday.


# Summary
Our Analysis shows that males are the biggest subscribers and users of the bike share program. It also showed that the bike usage is more frequently used during early hour, and late hour on the weekdays probably due to work commutes. It also showed that usage is more during the weekend due to more time for usage by clients. This information is useful for the company to create a new business in a different market.
